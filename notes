great. It gave me a clean extraction. Following was printed in the console : Found date via general pattern: 8-Apr-25
Now we have a general extraction working, I need the following :
1. Watchdog functionality to ensure new files are continuously process as well. If the input directory has files before the script was started it should also be processed.
2. If Consignee has a contact number in its address, it should be captured as a different field "Consignee Contact No". Similarly if it has email address, then it should capture it in "Consignee Email".
3. Do the same with Buyer as "Buyer Contact No." and "Buyer Email" fields.
