ok, following problems are observed :
1. invoice date is captured as 9-Apr-2025 whereas Invoice date should be 8-Apr-2025
2. e-Way Bill No is captured as value "Dated" whereas its correct value is "621886863349"
3. Dispatched Mode is captured as value "Mumbai Suburban, Maharashtra, Cont No. 9321098364 By Tempo West Mumbai" whereas the correct value is "By Tempo"
4. Motor Vehicle No. is captures as value "GSTIN/UIN : 27AAVPS1117M1Z3" but it should be "MH47Y9121".
5. Designation is captured as "Mumbai Suburban, Maharashtra, Cont No. 9321098364 By Tempo West Mumbai" but it should be "West Mumbai"
6. Delivery Note Date and Buyer Order No. is correct as blank value
7. Consignee Name is captured as "Leak Seal Dispatch Doc No. Delivery Note Date" but should be "Leak Seal".
Like wise many values are incorrectly captured but when you gave the list of values earlier to select which fields are needed, you had them correct.
